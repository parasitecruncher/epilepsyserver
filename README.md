## Environment

First you must install Virtualenv and pipenv
Then,
create virtualenv `virtualenv <env name>`
then run
`pipenv install --dev`
to install all pipenv libraries

*This will install all python dependencies for this project.*

**Google and learn what both of them are.**

##Django

Once all libraries are installed run
`./manage.py makemigrations`
and
`./manage.py migrate`
to create database.


## REST API Client

I've used Insomnia for it and exported a json file for it in the root folder. Simply import it from the Insomnia application.
Create some data for you to test out frontend.
